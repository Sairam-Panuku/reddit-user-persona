Title: EAS build distribution through firebase app tester
Body:   
I've recently set up EAS Build through GitHub Actions. The iOS build generation with `--auto-submit` works like a charm and is directly uploaded to TestFlight. However, the Android process is a bit messy. Google Play's internal distribution system is not very stable. Both production and testing builds are downloaded from the same location, which makes things a bit confusing.

I discovered Firebase App Distribution, which works as expected and also allows easy access to previous versions. I want to upload the EAS generated Android build to Firebase App Distribution. While I can do this manually using a command, I'm a bit confused about how to automate it using GitHub Actions, especially since EAS provides a download link after the build completes.

I've found some articles and videos, but none of them have been very helpful so far:

* [https://docs.expo.dev/build/internal-distribution/#android-build-and-distribute-an-apk](https://docs.expo.dev/build/internal-distribution/#android-build-and-distribute-an-apk)

Title: Integrating Supabase Auth with MSG91 OTP (India)
Body: Hey everyone,  
I‚Äôm working on an app that uses phone number OTP-based authentication only. I‚Äôve been testing with Supabase‚Äôs built-in OTP, but now I need to go live and use a real SMS provider.

Supabase supports Textlocal, but it‚Äôs shutting down in India. MSG91 is a better fit for me (price + availability), and I‚Äôm looking to integrate their OTP service with Supabase using the **Send SMS Auth Hook**.

I came across a few articles, but I‚Äôm still unsure how the verification and session creation work, especially how to connect MSG91‚Äôs OTP API to Supabase‚Äôs flow.

Has anyone here set up something similar using an Edge Function? Would really appreciate a code snippet or tips!

Thanks in advance üôå

Title: Firebase Notification Image in iOS expo
Body: I've integrated react-native-firebase in my Expo app, but to display images on iOS, it's required to create an extension file, as mentioned in the [documentation](https://rnfirebase.io/messaging/ios-notification-images). 

However, the documentation only provides guidance for the bare native workflow. I'm unable to find any config plugin that creates the extension file. I've been trying to create the plugin file for the extension for the past two weeks but haven't been able to do it properly. I took [this repo](https://github.com/nikwebr/expo-notification-service-extension-plugin) as a reference, but with no success. If anyone has implemented FCM in their project and created a config plugin, please share any GitHub URL if possible.

Title: Home Page Scroll Animation (Swiggy)
Body: Our app is a marketplace app, and we‚Äôve decided to redesign the homepage to include animations similar to what Swiggy uses. Instead of food, the homepage will feature products, along with categories, filters, location search, and other similar elements.

This type of interaction is very popular and used in many apps, so I‚Äôm sure some of you might have implemented something similar. I‚Äôd love to hear your insights!

1. Scrollable Components:

Did you use FlatList, FlashList, ScrollView, or create your own scrollable component using a gesture detector or handler? Which would you recommend for optimal performance and flexibility?



2. Animation Library:

Is React Native Reanimated the only viable option for achieving this type of animation, or were you able to achieve it using the default Animated API?



3. Challenges Faced:

What challenges did you face while implementing such an interaction? Which issues took the most time to fix?



4. Performance Optimization:

What steps did you take to ensure the best performance across all devices? Any tips for handling performance bottlenecks with large datasets and animations?




This new design is a big step up from our current homepage, which is just an infinite scrollable list of products without animations. I'll start working on it next Monday, and I‚Äôd really appreciate any advice to make this implementation smooth and performant.

If you have any code reference that will also help.


Thanks in advance for sharing your experiences!


I've to implement this anyway if I get any responses or not and after implementing I'll make sure to share my experience while implementing this. So make sure to upvote this post.

Title: Branch io deferred link in ios
Body: I'm using branch io in my expo app The setup is pretty straightforward and it works clicking on the link opens the all with defined params
It works fine in Android clicking on the link directly opens the app
But in iOS it redirects to the browser first then it loads there and shows a popup if I want to open the app

Initially I thought that's how it works in iOS
But yesterday I was checking the Amazon app and clicking on the shortlink instantly opens the app from anywhere 
As in my app it redirects to the browser first

The fact that there is no issue from the beach is that our app was initially built in flutter and it was working absolutely fine clicking on the link directly opens the app in iOS

I've checked the flutter branch package, react native branch package, and expo config plugin also 
But no luck 

Branch docs says that they do not officially support expo so I don't know If I should contact them or not

Please help if anyone has implemented this

Body: A while ago someone posted a karma calculator for zomato,
It calculates every thing how many times do you order in a month
What is your average order amount 
Your payment method 
Frequency of raising issues with order
Number of times you got a full refund or some refund 
And after that you get this type of experience

Body: That's something I also wanted to ask. Fingerprints are one thing, but what about dust particles getting under the keys, key scratches on the laptop screen, and dents and scratches on the body?

Everyone says not to use a case, not to laminate, and not to cover it, so what should we do to prevent all these issues?

Subreddit: indiasocial
Body: Years ago, my friend ran away from home because of her abusive father. She didn‚Äôt tell anyone where she was living. Later, her father called and threatened her, saying he knew where she was staying and even mentioned the name of the hotel she stayed in and some other details about payments dhe made. She was very scared.

When I asked her how he could know which hotel she stayed in, since she hadn‚Äôt told anyone, she said the bank manager was a friend of her father and must have given him her bank statement. I told her that even if the manager was a friend of her father, he had no right to access or share her bank details.

I called the bank‚Äôs customer care and asked if it was possible for someone else to get a person‚Äôs bank statement. They told me it wasn‚Äôt,  not even if the request came from a parent or family member. I asked what to do if someone had done that, and they advised me to file a complaint against the branch through the bank's official website.

I submitted a detailed complaint. Two days later, the branch manager called her and apologized for what he did. She was furious, and she hadn't forgiven him. When she went to the bank, the manager literally lay down at her feet and begged her to withdraw the complaint, which she eventually did, though I don‚Äôt know why.

A friend of mine who works near the bank (at an e-Mitra center) told me all of this. Since that day, no one at the bank dares to share any individual's information with family members or anyone else without proper authorization.
