Title: How to fix pink screen + reboot issues when NOTHING works!
Body: I had the issue in the title. NOTHING WAS WORKING! Resetting nvram, downgrading the system, etc. Tried everything for 3+ weeks. Nothing worked.

Apple Diagonostics showed that there no hardware issues. I knew that the support people at the stores had special needs, so I couldn't rely on them. They would chalk everything up to bad hardware and extort a gazillion dollars out of my ass. So I chose to not get into that path. Best decision.

I figured there was some memory leakage and thus tried limiting max kernel usage to 10% using cpusetter. That did fix it for perhaps a few days. But, somehow, after that I wasn't able to limit that program with cpusetter anymore. I don't know what happened but that option just *stopped* working for some reason!

Giving up, I thought of switching the OS to Asahi Linux. It worked perfectly!!!! Stayed on Asahi Linux for 3-4 weeks. After that, however, I figured out a solution that fixed the issue.

\----------------

On Asahi, very very rarely there used to be the pink screen issue. But the system didn't die. That made me think, "there is some sort of memory clogging happening". "Huh, what could it be?"

I knew about SWAP on linux, already, so that was my first thought. I never joined the connection earlier that the same thing could happen on macOS. Didn't think macOS also used SWAP (which is such a dumb assumption considering its built on fucking UNIX).

So my next thought was, "okay... what happens if I just straight up disable swap". So I read about swap, compression etc on macos. Disabled SIP, tried reading about boot-args, figure the command out... and... VOILA! It worked for 12 hours straight!

But then I thought of updating the system. I updated. The system reloaded. It ran for 30 mins maybe, before crashing again. Checked the boot-args. Apparently, the compressor\_mode has been modified to 4 again. But now I knew how this happened. I knew that on true strong shutdown (i.e. shutdown and wait 30+s before restarting), the nvram completely resets on macOS sillicon So, I learnt how to make that not happen! Turns out you can't change that. Atleast not so easily. So I just introduced an early level script that changes the boot-args to what I want them to be.

\---

TLDR:

* disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) using recoveryOS. Boot to macOS.
* Use the command \[ `sysctl -a vm.compressor_mode`\] to find out what option the compressor\_mode is set to. If it is 4, we need to change it to 2 or 1.
* Use the command \[`nvram boot-args="vm_compressor=1" && sudo reboot` \]
* Check if your system can stay without crashing for the next 10 hours. If it works, then automate setting this boot argument using an early boot script.
* ask claude about it to help you setup that script.

Title: Need help please: bootloop after UPDATE
Body: I have a macbook air m2. Recently I updated to Sequoia and then I got stuck into a bootloop. I searched through the internet and found a guide which told me to partition the drive and install sequoia on the new partition.

When I did that, it worked! I was also able to access the original install. However, me being an oversmart dumbass, I wasn't happy with that. Because I was able to enter the previous install, I figured "let's just delete the other partition". 

The bootloop appeared again.

Post that I have tried 100s of things. Deleting the drive completely and reinstalling Sonoma through Recovery. One of the times it worked. 

I thought of upgrading to Sequoia through that Sonoma (guessing things would be fine now). Spoiler: it wasn't.


I have tried the same things that led me to Sonoma before: but it doesn't work anymore. What the hell should I do?

Body: Normalization regards to the amount of people giving both exam: is exactly why they are taking percentiles. 

One cannot change reservation on a whim. There are laws and acts governing that. 

Again, removing the exam is unfair. They are trying to set a precedent that a economically weak student who performs well in Math in JEE or CUET would come to ISI.   
As the years go by, the best math people would take CUET and JEE Main both. These issues would be resolved automatically.   
Unfortunately, the first few batches would suffer.

Body: How do you normalize CUET percentiles and JEE percentiles then? Give me a logically sound system?

Conditional on the fact that everybody takes both the exams, this method becomes fair. But in the world we live in, the best students take JEE Mains and the others take CUET. This is why this anomaly is there. 

If one adjusts to that fact and makes a normalization formula that somehow could equate CUET with JEE Mains, you'd be saying "CUET applicants are inferior". The ISI admin would never do that. 

What is the solution then? 

\- Everybody takes both the exams.   
\- Make your own separate exam.   
\- Remove CUET. 

1 is unrealistic. There is probably a reason they didn't do 2. 3 is unfair.
