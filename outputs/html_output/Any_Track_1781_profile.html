Body: I'm a Senior Consultant Business Analyst in Infosys, resigned a month ago since I got 50% hike in another WITCH Company.

Last week, Manager called and asked there‚Äôs an Mexico onsite for Notice Period folks alone and I‚Äôm eligible.

1. Should I accept it and revoke my resignation?

2. I understand we want to get this in written everything. But even with written confirmation, they can give reason, there is no requirement. Hence skip this.

3. I‚Äôm a Bachelor, no plans to marry in next 5yrs, so I‚Äôm not worried on that part.

4. Mexico Gangs, Safety also not worried since I have 5-10 friends in Mexico who went from other companies.

5. How to calculate the expected Salary? Here it's 16 Lakhs.

6. Tomorrow, I have call with HR, What all to ask?

7. What is the average processing duration?

8. How to find is there really a project required available or this is a drama?

9. Also to mention, it‚Äôs been only 9 months in Infosys, Can they process now or wait till 12 months completion for HR to initiate the process?

10. Please feel free to add any other valuable points too.

Body: Even after moving to Chennai, I feel you may have some thoughts to settle in Vellore. So I'd suggest you to move to Vellore itself directly which makes you much sentimentally closer.
