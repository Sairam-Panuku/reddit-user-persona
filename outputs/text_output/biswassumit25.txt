Title: Credit card for first time user?
Body: I don't exactly need one. But I've read somewhere that it is safer because I can charge back incase of frauds. And keeping a cc helps building cibil score.

I am not a salaried individual, so if I get one, it'll probably be FD based.

Do I really need a cc now to build cibil score? I'm 26. I mean, if I get one after 5yrs when I'll need it, what problems I might face then?

Also, if you recommend me getting one, please recommend a specific card also. I don't have a car, I don't fly. I buy groceries from supermarket and buy 4-5 movie tickets a month (but I usually get some amount of cashback or discount from Paytm or bms nearly every time), I order food or dine outside once every week. I use IMPS a lot if that matters.

Title: Picked up two high risk MFs for SIP. Are they good?
Body: I'm 25, a first time investor and trying the SIP route. I can take risk. My main purpose is wealth creation. Currently I'll invest 5k/month in SIP and next year it'll be 10-15k/month. Long term >10year.


I'm thinking of inversting 2.5k in a equity oriented balanced fund. I thought of HDFC Balanced Direct Growth.


The rest 2.5k will be in equity funds. I'm thinking of Motilal Oswal MOSt Focused Multicap 35.


Please comment regarding my choices and also if I need to diversify more (like 2k-2k-1k) or not.

Title: What are some good vegetables/fruits which can be farmed in smaller area like 10ftx20ft, and profitable?
Body: Some ideas to keep my father busy in his own passion and simultaneously make money as I've been staying in hostel. 

Place and climate: In Mid West Bengal (Nadia), Soil is good and fertile (in the Ganges area, River Jalangi flows within 200m of the plot), Rain is moderate.

Constant supervision can be done as my dad is retired and loves to look after plants.. We hav lots of lau (gourd), pumpkin, karela, chilli, tomato, potol (pointed gourd, TIL) already there. But we use them mostly for ourselves and then gift the extras to relatives and neighbors. Never thought of making profit from these before.

Also they charge 300/yr AMC maintainance fee. So, total max 900/year.

On other hand people are angry because it's affecting the so called kulcha. I for one, don't think we've had enough of thiskulcha shit in our life already.

It also can be seen as freedom as expression. Banning is bad. People won't watch it if they don't like it and then the show will get cancelled. I don't think that people won't watch it though.

It can also spread stalking etc (I have not seen it so I don't know if any stalking etc is involved), but I don't think that's the only reason, most of the movies and serials do that. They didn't ask ban for all of them.

As I said, I'm confused about this.
